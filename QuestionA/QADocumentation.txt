This is a documentation for the The QuestionA programMethods:isLineValid(line_X1,line_X2): Takes floats parameters (line_X1 and line_X2). Returns a boolean value (true if line is valid, false if it is not)verifyLineCoordinates(line): Takes an array of float type as a parameter(line). Verifies a line's bounds where line[0] is supposed to be the lower bound and line[1] the upper bound. If its not the case, swaps bounds. Returns an array of float type with the same length as the paramaeter's arrayisValueInInterval(value,lower_bound,upper_bound): Takes floats parameters (value,lower_bound and upper_bound). Returns a boolean value (true if value is in [lower_bound,upper_bound], false if it is not)##Some explanations##This program's accuracy is somehow limited as the floating point input has a default to 28 places precision. Beyond that scope, the program's results may be incorrect.Also assumption has been made that the user could input lines positions X1 and X2 in any other. The program then checks the smallest and the biggest position and respectively sets them as the lower_bound and the upper_bound of the line concerned.
